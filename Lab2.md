# The graphs below were created with data from the Federal Census Bureau using API calls.

## What the graphs above reflect are datasets from 3 differenet years (2000, 2010, and 2014), which are intended to show the population growth of the 50 different states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico. Instead of putting all the data into one graph, the quantile command was used in R to break the data down in 4 different subsets so that it can be more easily interpreted. If you read the sides of the graphs you can see that the smallest states (by population size) are displayed in the top left hand corner and the largest can be found in the bottom right hand corner. Each graphs displays either 12 or 13 states, (two of the graphs include either Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia) and the next graph in the sequence has the next 13 larger states. If you look at any particualr graph you can pick a state and follow that state's line's slope to see how the population in this state has grown over time.
