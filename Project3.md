The graph above shows the country of Costa Rica. Costa Rica is divided into 7 provinces which are each then divided into smaller sectors called cantons. The map above has clustered labels in central Costa Rica due to the large number of cantons located in and around the capital city of San José. Costa Rica has a population of approximatley 5 million people and is located in Central America. Costa Rica is primarily surrounded by ocean, however, it does share its northern border with Nicaragua and southern border with Panema. 
Data for this graph was obtained from shape files on the GADM website.

The graphs above show San José, the most densley populated province in Costa Rica, which is also the capital. San José is located in central Costa Rica and has 20 cantons. I have also included Guanacaste, the least densley populated province province in Costa Rica which is located in northern Costa Rica and has 10 cantons.

The graph above shows the map of Costa Rica and the two provinces in the same image. Additionally, the two provinces are indicated on the map with boxes. One thing I found interesting about Costa Rica while doing this lab was the the population is farley well distributed. San José is home to 1.5 million people and Guanacaste is home to just over 500 thousand people. Some countries have regions that are almost completely without population due to factors such as scarcity of resources or unfavorable geography. However, all parts of Costa Rica have a fair amount of residents.
