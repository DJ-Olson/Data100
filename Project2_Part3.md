### Project Description
In this project I focused on stocks relating to sports. I used stocks for Nike, Adidas, Manchester United, Go Pro, and WWE to create my portfolio. By looking at the individual returns of each of the 5 stocks I was able to allocate specific proportions of my portfolio based on which stocks were the best earners and which were the worst. Graph 1 shows a upward trend meaning that the stocks in my portfolio made money over the 2 year period. The second graph shows how I chose to allocate $10,000 between the stocks and in the end, by January 1st, 2020 my $10,000 had grown to $12,435.25. This is a 25% increase from my initial investment.
