# How Data Science is Used in the Presidential Election

People don’t like uncertainty. This is why every four years people try to predict who will win the election well in advance of voting results coming out. However, in 2016 it seemed all but certain that Hillary Clinton was going to win the election, but when the results came out, it left a lot of people shocked and confused. This being said, with the 2020 election looming, it is important to try to understand how data science plays a role in predicting who the next president will be, and to do this, we need to understand exactly how data analytics can make such a big prediction. 

 To predict the election results, statistical models are created using data from past elections to train computer programs to predict future results. For example, in 2019 a regression problem was created “that predicts the % of votes the Democratic candidate will receive in the general election out of the total votes cast for either the Democrat or the Republican.” (Dale, What Will Happen in the 2020 Election?).  To do this data was pulled from a time period between 1976-2019. To test this model the data was used from previous years only to predict who would be the next president starting in the 1980 election to the 2016 election and a trend emerged showing that as time progressed and more data was assembled, predictions got more accurate. This makes sense because the more data you have to train a statistical model, the more comfortable the model will be with how elections usually result, and the more easily it will be able to make predictions. So, what we can take from this is it is essential to compile large amounts of past data from previous elections, especially the 2016 election in which Donald Trump already ran, in order to create accurate statistical models to predict the 2020 election. 
  
Now that we know what data is important it is necessary to understand what variables make up statistical models that predict presidential elections. A good example of this is presented in an article written by Skyler Dale on the “Towards Data Science” webpage. Dale looked at 4 different variables and created a model using 3 out of 4 of them and then 4 out of 4 of them to predict past election results. Dale looked at previous state vote share, prior year GDP growth, midterm election results, and presidential approval rating. Previous vote share showed that states tend to vote consistently and only states on the margins (swing states) have the ability to shift between parties. Economic growth showed that a struggling economy is more likely to vote democrat due to policies that benefit the lower and middle class, and a booming economy like republican policies. Midterm election results looked at how many votes each party received in the last congressional election. “The theory here is that midterms provide a pulse-check on how the country feels about the Party in power” (Dale, What Will Happen in the 2020 Election?). And finally, approval ratings for the previous president showed that sentiments of parties carry over between candidates (if the last democrat did a poor job the election is more likely to result in a republican president). The results of the models created using these four variables showed that from 2004 to present, the four factor model was quite accurate in predicting the election results.

 You may think that with such an accurate model it will be easy to predict the next election, and in theory this may be true. However, this model currently predicts a 279-259 win for the democratic party in the electoral college votes. This means that the model is predicting the election to be very close. So, if the model is mostly accurate, but can incorrectly predict one or two states the election could go the opposite way. For example, if the model predicts Wisconsin incorrectly (a current swing state) then the 279-259 prediction would change to a 269-269 tie. In summary, statistical models are capable of incredible predictions, but nothing is ever completely accurate. So, when trying to predict something such as the presidential election which is often very close, even a mostly accurate statistical model has the ability to make incorrect predictions. Thus, although it might make us feel better to think we can predict the future results of the election, as we saw in last election’s results, the future is often unpredictable.
