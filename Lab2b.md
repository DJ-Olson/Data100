# Lab 2b Population Growth Graphs
(Data for this lab was taken from the United States Census Bureau between the years of 2010 and 2014)

### The graphs below show absolute population increase in the 50 states, The District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

The line plots above facet the absolute population increase between 2010 and 2014 of all 52 primary US subdivisions into 9 quantiles. The graph in the top left shows the territories with the smallest absolute population growth (in some cases it's negative) and as the you follow the graphs from right to left, the graph in the bottom right shows the territories with the highest absolute population growth.

### This second set of graphs show the average annual population increase in the 50 states, The District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

The line plots above facet the average annual growth rate between 2010 and 2014 of all 52 primary US subdivisions into 9 quantiles. A slight difference you need to take into account when reading these graphs is that the territories with the highest average annual population increase start in the top left, and the graph with the territories with the lowest average annual population increase is located in the bottom right. This is the inverse of the graphs above.
