# Project 2 Part 2

This graphs below show correlation matrixes that describe the relationship between the predicted stock (amazon) and the prdictors stocks. For this lab I chose to focus on the entertainment industry since Amazon is really pushing Amazon Prime Video. So, I chose the stocks: AMC, Imax, Cinemarks, Disney, and CBS to be the predictor stocks. 


This second image summarizes the model numerically.
