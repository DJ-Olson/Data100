# Project 2 Part 2

This graphs below show correlation matrixes that describe the relationship between the predicted stock (amazon) and the prdictors stocks. For this lab I chose to focus on the entertainment industry since Amazon is really pushing Amazon Prime Video. So, I chose the stocks: AMC, Imax, Cinemarks, Disney, and CBS to be the predictor stocks.

This second image summarizes the model numerically. Unfortunatley when you look near the bottom of the summary statistics we can see that the R-Value is below 0.5 which is not very close to 1. This means that this model is not particularly significant and the predicted results may not be very accurate.
