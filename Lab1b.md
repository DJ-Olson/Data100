The graph above shows the total number of applications recevied by institutions offering a minimum of a doctoral degree. If you look at the bar graph you can see that the institutions are classified by region. Then, each region is further broken down by state. The data used in this graph, which was compiled in 2015, was taken from the National Center for Education Statistics website.
