#Data Science in Fantasy Football 

Every year millions of Americans try to emulate the feeling of being an NFL coach by assembling their own fantasy football rosters. However, not only is it a fun way to stay in touch with your friends through a little friendly competition, but due to the popularity of sports betting, the fantasy football market is estimated today at $18.6 billion dollars. With so much money on the line you can see why people are willing to use data science to gain any advantage they can when drafting their team and setting their lineup.
  
Before we get too far into this discussion let me quickly summarize what fantasy football is and how it works. Essentially you create a league with an even amount of players, let's say 10 for example, and then you take turns drafting NFL players onto your team. During the draft you need to draft players at each position and then once the football season starts you set your roster by starting certain players. Then your team scores a certain amount of points based on how well your players did in real life during their games. So, for example if you drafted Tom Brady and her through 3 touchdowns and had 300 passing yards he will have scored you 24 points (4 points per passing touchdown and 1 point for every 25 passing yards). Each week you are matched against someone else in your league and whoevers team scores more points wins. 

Now that we have established a basic understanding of how fantasy football works, let’s get into how data science can help give players the edge in their weekly matchups. In an article written by Gordon Yun in 2018 he discussed how he built an efficient statistical model in R that tries to accurately predict how many points a given player will score in a week. To start he said that in past years he would simply copy and pasted weekly statistics from Yahoo Sports into excel and analyzed them there. But this process proved to be inefficient and not very accurate, so he “built a solution to web-scraping weekly statistics using Python, and then synthesized the data with R” (Yun, 2018). 

The fantasy football app that many players use today provides rankings for each player at their position. However, one problem with this feature is that it simply adds up how many points they have scored this season and ranks them accordingly. In Yun’s method he recognizes that “teams’ performance may differ substantially between September and November” (Yun, 2018). To combat this issue he put a function into his R script that allowed users to specify how far back in the season data was drawn from so points projections could be made off of recent games and not the season as a whole. 

Additionally Yun also took into account matchups. Just because one player is better than another at their position does not mean you should start them. First you need to think about how each player will match up against the team they’re playing.To do this Yun built into his model a function to multiply a team’s offensive performance by their opponent’s defensive performance. In Yun’s words, “if a team is scoring a lot of points, yards, touchdowns or goals, I like a match-up where their opponent is also giving up a lot of the same. So creating a pair-wise variable by multiplying the two features was the operation I ran with for now to ensure such scenarios were highlighted by the numbers” (Yun, 2018).

See script below:


Within Yun’s script are many more variables that are also taken into account such as how teams fare against each other historically, how players have played previously in certain weather conditions, and so on. But, from the examples provided I hope you can see just how in depth his model goes. The goal of this reflection is not to provide a complete guide to how Yun’s script works, but instead to highlight just how widely data science can be applied. When fantasy football started people often drafted their favorite players on their favorite teams and used it as a way to give Sunday football even more meaning. However, now methods such as Yun’s have been developed to make what used to be a game that had a lot to do with luck, scientific. If you are willing to collect the data and put in the time to analyze it, there really is no boundary to what you can achieve. So, if you find yourself wanting to dominate your friends next year in a fantasy football league, consider data science as the catalyst.
