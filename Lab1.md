# Lab 1 
Lab 1 looked at datasets from counties in Liberia. It used two datasets, one being source data and the other being remote. From these datasets a number of graphs were created to better illustrate a picture of how populations were distributed throughout the counties. Additional graphs were also collected to show the differences in the two datasets.

## Below are the Graphs for Lab 1:
