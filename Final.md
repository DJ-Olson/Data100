This first plot is of the de facto boundaries of human settlements in Pérez Zeledón, a cantón in Costa Rica. The polygons within the region of Pérez Zeledón are the most popuated urban areas in the cantón. The dots within the urbane area polygons represent the population density of the areas, and they can be interpreted using the key to the right of the map.

This second plot adds the roads and airports of Pérez Zeledón. Costa Rica categorizes airports as small, medium, and large. However, Pérez Zeledón only has small airports. The seven blue dots represent these airports. Most of the airports are close to the most densly populated polygon in the center of Pérez Zeledón and are connecte by thr roadways which only run throught the middle of the cantón. It is interesting to see how the roads do not extend outside the cantón, but when you view image 3, you will understand Pérez Zeledón lies within a dense mountain range so it is very hard to leave the cantón by road.

Lastly, this is a 3D version of the previous plot. The most densley populated urban area, San Isidro de El General, is indicated by the white line. I chose not to label it directly on the graph and instead indicate it by a line because the long name covered other important features. What this 3D image highlights about Pérez Zeledón is that the cantón is isolated from the rest of Costa Rica due to the mountains around it. This is why seven small airports are neccessary, in order to allow resident of the cantón to travel by means other than roadways.
