### DJ Olson

Hi guys! I'm DJ, I'm a sophmore at W&M studying finance and economics. I took this class because the Coll 150 wicked problems sparked my interest in data science, and I have found that I enjoy anaylzing and solving real world problems using data and anaylitics. At W&M I am a member of the fraternity Kappa Sigma, and I sprinted on the track team last year (although I may not this year due to injury). I come from Wellesley MA, but I am a big fan of the much warmer winters in Williamsburg.
